    "# Introduction:\n",
    "The term “range anxiety” describes the vast tendency many new car buyers have when becoming prospective electric vehicle (EV) owners. This stems from the fear that drivers will run out of electricity before they can find a charging station. This project targets \"range anxiety\" among potential EV owners by finding routes that can show routes optimized to finding the least amount of charge stations to get from LA to New York. <br>\n",
    "The project focuses on a minimum-cost flow network problem with the goal of have finding the shortest path between destinations while \n",
    "requiring there to be enough charge stations between destinations. <br> "

    "# Model and Approach\n",
    "The approach started with developing a min-cost flow network problem by considering only the cost of \"distances\". A small scale of 10 randomly sampled charge stations in the LA area were selected. Distances were measured in euclidian distances. The greatest challenge was handling the memory consumption of billions of arcs. With several points of weakness in this project for bugs: python syntax, GAMS syntax, model design, etc, memory issues was the least expected challenge. <br>\n",
    "The method starts with filtering locations that deviated to far from a direct line that ran between LA and NYC. This created a corridor. A KMeans algorithm was then implemented to create labelled data based on clusters. The number of clusters, the number of locations sampled per cluster, and the threshold for sampling in a cluster are parameters created and used to control the amound of nodes and arcs that had to be computed. Networks with more then 4000 nodes were computationally impossible as GAMS would complain about running out of memory. <br>\n",
    "Lastly, electric vehicles with ranges from 92 to 900 km are allowed and accounted for. This data was gathered from the secondary data set mentioned in the project spec. These vehicle range parameters are used to enable or disable arcs: if an node is further then the range of the vehicle, the arc connecting the two nodes would be zero and filtered out in the model."

    "In conclusion, range anxiety is slowly becoming a thing in the past. Despite the computational limits of my implementation, vehicle ranges below >250 kilometers are feasible in a road trip from LA to NYC. The mean EV range from the electric car data is aruond 338  which plots to be a road distance of  However, electric vehicles below that range will definitely struggle. Most importantly is the proof of concept of the feasibility of EVs in a larger network and that uses for smaller trips such as intrastate trips are extremely feasible. There is definitely a \"charge sink\" that is in the heartland of the US which posed the greatest boundary for EVs trying to make the trip. Public may impact feasibility but feasibiblity is overshadowed by range."
